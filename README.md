Airecruiteer is a web application built using Flask, Python, PyPDF2, and Groq's LLaMA3 LLM. It allows users to upload their resumes in PDF format. The backend extracts resume content and sends it to an AI model that acts as an expert HR. It reviews the resume, highlights missing sections, and gives tailored improvement suggestions â€” making it a valuable tool for job seekers to improve their profiles.
